Project Title: WanderWise â€“ Your Ultimate Travel Guide

Project Overview:

This site, WanderWise, would be the ideal travel website built to help discover and find places for any given person. They will not be restricted to the most noted tourist attractions but will also include not-so-famous hidden treasures which are missed without much notice. Any person can view the many places they are interested in, read reviews and view photos, or catch on to tips about traveling well.

1. Search by Location: The user can find a city or region and see a list of the top attractions- popular places, must-see sights, and off-the-beaten-path destinations.

2. Attractions Categories: Places will be categorized into historical sites, nature spots, adventure locations, and hidden gems.

3. Reviews & Ratings of Users: Travelers can share their experiences and help a traveler in rating places to go.

4. Interactive Map: A visualization tool that people can use to locate places in their surroundings.

5. Personalized Recommendations: Based on the places people like, the website will make recommendations of the places they may be interested in.

6. Itinerary Builder: This helps users build their trips and arrange them.

7. Photo Gallery & Blogs: This platform is used to share the user's stories and photos with others in the community.

Why This Project: I

really loved the idea since it speaks so well with me and my travel-loving personality; that's because I am someone who really likes going to places they haven't explored yet. Sometimes it is difficult to find such 'hidden treasures.' So, my idea is to create a service that puts everyone, famous as well as little-known spots in the limelight. By this project, I will improve on all the skills associated with web development, APIs, and user interface during the development.
